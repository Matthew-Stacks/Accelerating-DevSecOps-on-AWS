Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) has never been simple, but these days the landscape is more bewildering than ever; its terrain riddled with blind alleys and pitfalls that seem almost designed to trap the less-experienced developer.

* Use AWS Codestar to design and implement a full branching strategy
* Enforce Policy as Code using CloudFormation Guard and HashiCorp Sentinel
* Master app and infrastructure deployment at scale using AWS Proton and review app code using CodeGuru
* Deploy and manage production-grade clusters using AWS EKS, App Mesh, and X-Ray
* Harness AWS Fault Injection Simulator to test the resiliency of your app
* Wield the full arsenal of AWS Security Hub and Systems Manager for infrastructure security automation
* Enhance CI/CD pipelines with the AI-powered DevOps Guru service
